            <h2>Ramble Of The Week</h2> <br>

            <h1>Updates!</h1> <br>
            <br>
            <p class="par">Been a while, hasn't it? Hell I know no one's gonna read this, at least in a little while,
                but if in
                future I got famous and people read my unrestrained stream of thoughts that is also known as this blog,
                hi! How you doing?
                Anyways, if you <i>are</i> reading this and have read the other posts, you might have wondered why there
                is a 2 week gap
                in posts, the answer for that is quite simple: I was too lazy to fork the site and keep updating it as
                my teacher graded the
                original github repo and code. Now that all that is done, I've learned my lesson, fork your stuff, but
                at least you get to
                laugh at my lazyness, which I imagine will likely not change much at all in the future.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="par">But, alas, that is that and this is this. So what do I bring to you this week to justify my
                ramblings?
                Updates! I've got a few ideas and plans on what to do with the site and what to improve so I might as
                well tell you what
                I'm planning since I don't have anything else I want to put on the homepage right now and I don't feel
                like thinking up
                another deranged ramble about two topics that barely link together. Don't worry I'm sure I'll think of
                one in the meantime
                between now and next week's RoTW. Might make a post about music, we'll see.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="par"> <b>Changes that you, the reader, will notice:</b> Visual updates! Plenty of them coming (I
                think). I like
                design I've got going on right now, it's very functional and uncluttered, BUT it isn't perfect or all
                too close to finished
                or the final goal. Better navigation, a search bar, maybe some small sections on the left or right of
                the pages to quickly switch
                between posts, better methods of plugging my stuff (be it books or whatever else) in the future for when
                I finally get off my ass
                and publish something, maybe even a tagging system for a better search functionality, if I feel fancy
                some week, and also a new logo,
                I think I've got a really good pic of Caiman to put up there. Functionality! Actual and working forms,
                none of this stuff that I set up
                there in the gone Poll section only for my teacher to grade. I want to allow people to leave comments
                and send reports or mail of some kind through the site, though of course I have an
                email set up and should probably put it somewhere on the page, probably in the <a
                    href="./About.html">About</a> section.
            </p>
            <p class="par">Other things I want to do are making the nav bar and footer be sticky to the top and bottom
                of the viewport or whatever you
                call it. Maybe only the header, not so sure about making the footer sticky. Changing the style of the
                header and maybe new fonts are two things
                that are also on the table. Not very happy with how barrent the header is right now, but that may change
                once I get a new logo.
                Better functionality on vertical displays! As of right now, the site is mostly perfectly
                <i>functional</i> on vertical displays, but at times
                functional isn't enough. Among some of the issues are the fact that the main text gets very squished
                between the two side bars of nothing, bars
                which work well on horizontal displays and add a little character (IMO) but on vertical displays take up
                valuable space for not much return.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="par"> <b>Changes that I and anyone who decides to press F12 will notice:</b> Better code! As far
                as I know my code is alright
                and that validator doesn't see any issue <i>but</i> that doesn't mean it can't get better. I'm sure
                there's some poor practices in it,
                probablt in the .css file, speaking of which, I hope to learn it better and be able to do some more
                stuff while knowing what I'm doing
                instead of taking it from stack overflow and taking it for granted. A better way to post! Writing code
                is fun but man I'm very sure I'll
                I'll be more inclined to throw stuff here if I have a markdown text editor or something in-site (for me
                and myself only of course).
                Or maybe not having one is better, means I'm forced to think more about what I want I'm going to post
                and I have more time to think about
                it as I write it out on code, ensure it's working right and upload it to github (or whatever hosting
                service I use in the future). Regardless,
                I'll have to get one working for the comment system. Another thing I want to do is make it so whenever I
                add a post it automatically gets linked
                in Rambles with an automatic preview of the first paragraph or so. Don't really know to what extent that
                is possible, but any little convinient QoL
                feature is appreciated.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="par"> <b>Changes already done:</b> New URL and repo! I've moved onto a new github repo that will
                make it easier to type out the URL, that,
                and minor text adjustments (left-align text and padding at the bottom of the page) are the two things I
                can think of out of the top of my head.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="par">That's about it for now, I'm pretty sure. I'll put up some more interesting posts in <a
                    href="./Rambles.html">Rambles</a> in the near
                future. Until then, thanks for reading, and I'll see you next time!
